## Our Progress so Far...

So we've taught you some of the basics behind writing computer programs:

* Creating a python program as a
  [`.py` text file](../lesson_1/#First_Python_File) (with a text editor), and
  running it
* [Variables](../lesson_1/#Variables) (and
  [manipulating them](../lesson_2/#Manipulating_Variables))
* [Mathematical Operations](../lesson_1/#Mathematical_Operations)
* [Types](../lesson_2/#Types)
* [String Manipulation](../lesson_2/#Manipulating_Strings)
* [Lists](../lesson_2/#Lists)
* [**for** loops](../lesson_2/#For_Loop)
* [**while** loops](../lesson_2/#While_Loop)
* [**if** Statements](../lesson_2/#If_Statements) and
  [**booleans**](../lesson_2/#Bool_Type)
* Console [Input](../lesson_2/#Console_Input) and
  [Output](../lesson_2/#Console_Output)
* [Dictionaries](../lesson_3/#Dictionaries)
* [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

And we've asked you to write a small game using these skills, giving you less
guidance throughout that task.

Hopefully at this stage, you should feel quite confident with each of these. If
there is something that you are not 100% sure about, have a quick read over
that section.

## The Goal of This Lesson

This lesson will get you to use these techniques in a number of tasks of
increasing difficulty. The goal is that hopefully, practicing these techniques
over and over again to solve different problems will enable you to work out how
you can approach solving real-life problems you will come accross while coding
in the wild.

## The Tasks

The tasks given in this lesson are the kind of things you will come accross
when trying to write *almost any program*. When you are writing a program,
whether it is a smartphone app, a computer program, something controlling a
radio-controlled hellicopter, or even just a website... you will **need to
process data**.

Being able to come up with code that can process data in a particular way is a
**vital skill** to being a good programmer, and you can only get better with
**more practice and experience**.

All of these tasks come with **Test Code** that checks to see if the final code
of the task works as expected.

  <div class="panel-heading"><strong>Note</strong></div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you save your answer to each task as
    a separate file! Create a new folder called <code>lesson_4</code> and save
    each of the tasks in there. For example, use the filename
    <code>001.py</code> for the first task.

<br/><a id="Tasks_5_to_8"></a>
## Tasks 5-8: Basic `while` Loops

Tasks 5-8 will be doing tasks 1-4 but using `while` loops instead of `for`
loops.

Whenever you write a `for` loop, you can convert your code to use a `while`
loop instead!

**Example:**

    for item in my_list:
        print item

Is the same as

    index = 0
    while index < len(my_list):
        item = my_list[index]
        print item

        index += 1

Basically, a `for` loop is a special kind of `while` loop that makes writing
some code look much nicer. For the following exercises, we want you to use the
technique given in the example above to try and understand what the `for` loop
is doing, and convert it to a more complicated `while` loop.



<br/><a id="Task_5"></a>

#### Boilerplate Code:

Replace all of the ellipses (`...`).

    def min_list(lst):
        min = ... # What should we set this value to to begin with?

        index = 0
        while index < len(lst):
            item = lst[index]
            print item

            ... # What goes here?

            index += 1

        return min

    # Test Code
    print "Testing..."

    print min_list([5, 2, 7, 1, 9]) # This should be 1
    print min_list([5, 2, -7 ,1 ,9]) # This should be -7

## Tasks 13-16: Improving `sum_list_of_lists`

<br/><a id="Task_13"></a>
### Task 13: Flattening a list of lists

#### Instructions:

Create a function `flatten`, that, when given a list of lists, produces
a list containing the same elements, all in one list.

i.e. `[[1, 2], [3]]` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`

#### What you need to know:

* [Variables](../lesson_1/#Variables)
* [Lists](../lesson_2/#Lists)
* [**for** loops](../lesson_2/#For_Loop) or
  [**while** loops](../lesson_2/#While_Loop)
* [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

#### Boilerplate Code:

Replace all of the ellipses (`...`)

    def flatten(lst):
        acc = [] # The accumulating list
        ...
        return acc

    # Test Code
    print "Testing"

    print flatten([]) # []
    print flatten([[], []]) # []
    print flatten([[1], [2]]) # [1, 2]
    print flatten([[1, 2], [3]]) # [1, 2, 3]
    print flatten([[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5]]) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

<br/><a id="Task_14"></a>
### Task 14: Using `sum_list` in `sum_list_of_lists`

#### Instructions:

When writing your first implementation of `sum_list_of_lists` you may have
written the function using nested loops (one `for` or `while` loop inside
another). However, your inside for loop, looks suspiciously similar to the loop
inside `sum_list`.

Why is that? It's because they are both doing the same thing: Summing a list to
produce a number. This means your inner loop can be replaced with `sum_list`.

Perform the replacement in your version of `sum_list_of_lists` and make sure the
behaviour remains unchanged.

#### What you need to know:

 * [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

#### Boilerplate Code and Expected Output

Same as for [Task 12](#Task_12)

<br/><a id="Task_15"></a>
### Task 15: Using `flatten` in `sum_list_of_lists`

#### Instructions:

If you compare the outputs of `flatten` and `sum_list_of_lists` on the same
lists, you may notice a pattern: If you sum the result of `flatten` you get
the result of `sum_list_of_lists`. This happens to always be true, and we can
take advantage of this fact to make `sum_list_of_lists` **even** shorter.

Replace the definition of `sum_list_of_lists` with calls to `flatten` and
`sum_list`, making sure the behaviour stays the same once again.

#### What you need to know:

 * [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

#### Boilerplate code and Expected Output:

Same as for [Task 12](#Task_12)

<br/><a id="Task_16"></a>
### Task 16: Generalising `flatten`

#### Instructions:

What if you wanted to define a function called `sum_nested_lists`, which sums
the elements of a list, no matter how deeply they are nested, (even if they
aren't nested to the same level)?

We can simplify this problem into one we understand: summing a single list. We
do this by once again flattening the inputted list so it has no nested lists,
but still contains the same elements.

But if we give our current flatten function a list like `[[1, 2], 3]`, it would
complain, because the outer list doesn't contain all lists. And furthermore, if
we tried to give it a list like `[[[1, 2], [3]], [[4, 5], [6]]]` then it would
also break because the lists are nested more deeply than it is designed to deal
with.

We need to create a function that checks the types of all the elements that it
sees, before adding them  to `acc`. And if the item is a list, we should
flatten it too, before adding its elements.

#### What you need to know:

* [Variables](../lesson_1/#Variables)
* [Lists](../lesson_2/#Lists)
* [**for** loops](../lesson_2/#For_Loop) or
  [**while** loops](../lesson_2/#While_Loop)
* [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

#### Boilerplate:

Replace all of the ellipses (`...`)

    def flatten(lst):
        acc = [] # The accumulating list
        for x in lst:
            if type(x) == list:
                ... # Flatten it before adding
            else:
                ... # Append the element

        return acc

    def sum_nested_lists(lst):
        ... # Same as for `sum_list_of_lists` after task 15.

    # Test Code
    print "Testing"

    print sum_nested_lists([]) # 0
    print sum_nested_lists([[], []]) # 0
    print sum_nested_lists([1, 2, 3]) # 6
    print sum_nested_lists([[[]], []]) # 0
    print sum_nested_lists([[1, 2], 3]) # 6
    print sum_nested_lists([[1, 2], [3, []], [[[4]]]]) # 10

#### Expected Output:

    0

## Tasks 17-20: Sorting lists

Sorting lists is a task that a lot of time has been spent trying to master, in
the computing world. There are several ways to sort lists, but we are going
to look at some simple options here that are easy to understand.

Neither of the implementations you reach will be perfect or very efficient, but
they will capture the essence of the task (the *algorithm*) and they will work.
The first algorithm is rarely used in the real world, although the second is
very popular, in some of its other forms.

<br/><a id="Task_17"></a>
### Task 17: Removing the smallest element

#### Instructions:

Create a function called `remove_min` that, when given a list, finds its minimal
element and deletes it from the list, returning the element it deleted.

You will find that this function is very similar to your previous function,
`min_list`, and you can use this fact to guide you in the implementation of
`remove_min`.

We will use this function later on, in a sorting algorithm called *selection
sort*.

#### What you need to know:

 * [Variables](../lesson_1/#Variables)
 * [Lists](../lesson_2/#Lists)
 * [**while** loops](../lesson_2/#While_Loop)
 * [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

#### Boilerplate Code:

Replace all of the ellipses (`...`)

**Note:** the `del` command, introduced for dictionaries, also works for lists
in the natural way: `del lst[2]` will remove the element at index 2.

**Note:** you may find it helpful to use a `while` loop in this task because you
will need to keep track of the index of the minimal element as well as the
element itself, so you can delete it.

    def remove_min(lst):
        if len(lst) == 0: return # Nothing to remove for empty lists

        min_i = 0
        min   = lst[0]
        i     = 1

        ... # Loop through the list, finding the smallest element
        ... # Delete the minimal element
        return min

    # Test Code
    print "Testing"

    test = [3,4,8,9,7]
    print remove_min(test), test # 3 [4, 8, 9, 7]
    print remove_min(test), test # 4 [8, 9, 7]
    print remove_min(test), test # 7 [8, 9]
    print remove_min(test), test # 8 [9]
    print remove_min(test), test # 9 []

### Task 18: Selection sort

#### Instructions:

If you look at the output from the testing of `remove_min` you will see
that succesive calls to `remove_min` return the elements of list in
increasing order. We can exploit this in our sorting algorithm: We remove the
minimal element from the list, until there are no elements left, appending each
in turn to the end of a new list.

#### What you need to know:

 * [Variables](../lesson_1/#Variables)
 * [Lists](../lesson_2/#Lists)
 * [**while** loops](../lesson_2/#While_Loop)
 * [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

#### Boilerplate Code:

Replace all the ellipses (`...`)

    def selection_sort(lst):
        sorted = []
        list_len = len(lst) # Store this now because our loop will make it
                            # smaller

        ... # Loop through the list removing minimal elements from `lst` and
            # appending them to `sorted`.

        return sorted

    # Test Code
    print "Testing"

    selection_sort([]) # []
    selection_sort([1, 2, 3]) # [1, 2, 3]
    selection_sort([3, 4, 8, 9, 7]) # [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
    selection_sort([-8, 8, 4, -4, -2, 2]) # [-8, -4, -2, 2, 4, 8]

#### Expected Output:

    []
    [1, 2, 3]
    [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
    [-8, -4, -2, 2, 4, 8]

### Task 19: Partitioning a list

#### Instructions:

Partitioning involves taking a list, and producing two lists that together
contain all the elements of the original in such a way that all the elements in
one list are the elements less than some provided value (which we will call the
`pivot`) and all the elements in the other list are greater than or equal to the
`pivot`.

#### What you need to know:

* [Variables](../lesson_1/#Variables)
* [Lists](../lesson_2/#Lists)
* [**for** loops](../lesson_2/#For_Loop) or
  [**while** loops](../lesson_2/#While_Loop)
* [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

#### Boilerplate Code:

Replace all the ellipses (`...`)

    def partition(pivot, lst):
        lt, gte = [], [] # Less than, and greater than or equal to lists

        ... # Loop through lst, filling `lt` and `gte`

        return lt, gte

    # Test Code
    print "Testing"

    print partition(0, []) # ([], [])
    print partition(1, [1, 2, 3]) # ([], [1, 2, 3])
    print partition(2, [1, 2, 3]) # ([1], [2, 3])
    print partition(4, [1, 2, 3]) # ([1, 2, 3], [])

#### Expected Output:

    ([], [])
    ([], [1, 2, 3])
    ([1], [2, 3])
    ([1, 2, 3], [])

### Task 20: Quicksort

#### Instructions:

Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm that relies upon the principle of
partitioning lists.

 * Given a particular pivot element in the list (for convenience, let us just
   use the first element) partition the **rest** of the list according to the
   pivot.
 * Now if we slot the pivot element in between the elements less than it and
   greater than or equal to it, we find the pivot is in the *right place in the
   list*.
 * But the two lists provided by partition are not in sorted order, so how do we
   deal with them? Well, we use our `quicksort` function to sort those too.
 * Additionally, we say that lists with one or fewer elements are trivially
   sorted, so we can just return them without doing any work.

Use the hints above to define a function `quicksort` that uses partition to sort
the list provided to it.

#### What you need to know:

* [Variables](../lesson_1/#Variables)
* [Lists](../lesson_2/#Lists)
* [**for** loops](../lesson_2/#For_Loop) or
  [**while** loops](../lesson_2/#While_Loop)
* [Functions](../lesson_3/#Functions)

#### Boilerplate Code:

Replace the ellipses (`...`)

**Note:** It may be useful to know that python has a feature that allows you to
access a part of a list, i.e. `lst[n:]` means the elements from index
`n` onwards. This may be useful when trying to get all the elements bar the
first (which we use as the pivot).

    def quicksort(lst):
        # Lists of length 1 or 0 are already sorted, just return them
        if len(lst) <= 1: return lst

        pivot = ... # The first element
        left, right = partition(pivot, ...) # Partition the rest of the list

         # Sandwich the pivot between the sorted left and right sides
        return ... + [pivot] + ...

    # Test Code
    print "Testing"

    quicksort([]) # []
    quicksort([1, 2, 3]) # [1, 2, 3]
    quicksort([3, 4, 8, 9, 7]) # [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
    quicksort([-8, 8, 4, -4, -2, 2]) # [-8, -4, -2, 2, 4, 8]

#### Expected Output:

Same as for [Task 18](#Task_18)
