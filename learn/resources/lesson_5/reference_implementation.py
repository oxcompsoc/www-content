"""
A full implementation of a game for the Coding Lesson:
http://ox.compsoc.net/learn/resources/lesson_3/

This program does not take advantage of a lot of python language features, as
it only uses techniques that have been taught thus far. In addition, standard
coding practices have been dropped in favour of making understandable code for
people who have been following our course from the start, up until this point.
