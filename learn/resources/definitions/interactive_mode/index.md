**Interactive mode** is a way of interacting with Python where, instead of
handing the [[interpreter]] an entire source file to run, you enter a program
line by line, seeing the results of each command as it's run. As such, it's
more of a dialogue between you and Python, and is very good for testing out new
concepts and ideas and learning the language.

## Running Python in Interactive Mode

To run python in interactive mode, simply open up your terminal, and type
`python` then hit `Enter`.
