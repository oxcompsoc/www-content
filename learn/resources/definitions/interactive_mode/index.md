**Interactive mode** is a way of interacting with Python where, instead of handing the [[interpreter]] an entire source file to run, you enter a program line by line, seeing the results of each command as it's run. As such, it's more of a dialogue between you and Python, and is very good for testing out new concepts and ideas and learning the language.
