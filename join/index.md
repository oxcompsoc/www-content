All matriculated members of Oxford University are welcome to apply for ordinary
membership of Compsoc. A membership form can be downloaded and printed from
here: [Membership Form](form.pdf).

*Note: Anyone may attend talks, "learn to code", and most other events run
by CompSoc for free (excluding geek night).*

Please hand your completed membership and payment form to a committee member at
any event.

For more information on Compsoc membership, please contact the Secretary.

##Membership Prices

* **£5** for Life
* **£3** for a Year

Since our membership fees are so low already we are not offering a Freshers
Discount. Cheques should be made payable to "Oxford University Computer
Society".

##Associate Membership

We also have a limited number of associate memberships available for those who
are not matriculated members of the University. Associate members may
not be elected to the committee or vote at general meetings, and are granted at
the discretion of the committee. Currently, the membership fee for associate
membership is the same as that for ordinary membership.
